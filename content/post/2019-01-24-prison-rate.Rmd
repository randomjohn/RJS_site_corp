# Purpose

In continuing with Tidy Tuesday analysis, I do a very short post based on the prison rate dataset. Because time was short, I only did a couple of quick visualizations. There is a lot to this rich dataset, and this is only going to be a drop in the bucket. In fact, I don't even download all of the files (for the purpose of this blog post). Really this was a chance to dip my toes in `ggplot2`'s `geom_sf`, which makes plotting maps a *lot* simpler than it used to me.

# Setup

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
library(gganimate)
```

# Get data

Here I get data from two sources. First is the Tidy Tuesday website. The second is map geometry from the `tigris` package. The `tigris` package was updated some time ago to be compatible with the simple features `sf` package, making map plotting a lot smoother.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results= 'hide'}
prison_pop <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-22/prison_population.csv")

state_sf <- states(class = "sf")
```

# Munge and present data

The `prison_pop` dataset is at the county level, and, if I had wanted to, I could have merged it with the results of `states(class = "sf")` and produced a choropleth map that way. However, I aimed high and wanted to do an animated map. It takes a long time to do that, so I'll summarize data at the state level. I'll also produce a quick static map.

```{r}
prison_pop %>% 
  group_by(year, state, pop_category) %>% 
  summarize(population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE),
            prison_population = sum(prison_population, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(prison_rate = prison_population / population * 100000) %>% 
  ungroup() ->
  state_prison_pop


state_sf %>% 
  left_join(state_prison_pop, by = c("STUSPS" = "state")) ->
  state_prison_map

state_prison_map %>% 
  filter(year == 2000, pop_category == "Total", !STUSPS %in% c("AK", "HI")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = prison_rate)) +
  labs(title = "Prison rate for Year 2000")
```

What I really want to do, and the crowning achievement of this post, is the above, but animated throughout all years. It's pretty easy with the new version of the `gganimate` package. Here's the code, though I've pre-rendered the file for this blog post. This takes a pretty long time even on my beefy system. I've also cut out our compatriots to the northwest and southwest, and at some point I might try learning the inset tricks.


```{r eval=FALSE}
state_prison_map %>% 
  filter(pop_category == "Total", !STUSPS %in% c("AK", "HI"))  %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = prison_rate)) +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}") +
  theme_void()
```

That's it for now. Short and sweet.
