<p>Like many others, I’ve had an emotional rollercoaster of a year in 2017. Bob Rudis has published a <a href="https://rud.is/b/2017/12/29/2017-quantified-in-r/">quantified self</a> kind of retrospection, but, alas, I haven’t really participated in Stack Overflow, Twitter, or even blogging to do something similar. what I have done is peeked out of the pharma world enough to see trends in business, finance, and open data. And so that’s where I begin 2018.</p>
<p>In the coming year, I see my interests evolving:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stronger focus on collection and analysis of open and public data, with an emphasis on describing and predicting events that affect us on a local level (and I’ll be using my own area of Upstate South Carolina as an example)</li>
<li>More widespread use of Bayesian statistics, especially as a way to combine inference from disparate data sources in a disciplined way</li>
<li>A focus on combining the hopeful accessibility of data science with the rigor of classical statistics to improve interpretability and reduce errors in reasoning</li>
<li>And new content twice a month</li>
</ul>
<p>With that, I wish you a Happy 2018!</p>
<p>See you in two weeks!</p>
