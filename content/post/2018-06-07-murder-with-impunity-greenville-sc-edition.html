<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> recently had an article <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/unsolved-homicide-database/?utm_term=.540eacb9f59d">“Murder with Impunity”</a> Where they collected and curated data on unsolved murders. They have published their raw data publicly (see the link for more info), and I analyze that here.</p>
