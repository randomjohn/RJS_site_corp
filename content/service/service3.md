Reproduce and improve your analyses.

<!--more-->

Any analysis is ineffective if it isn't documented or reproducible. Document the reasons for each decision, no matter how small, to be able to reproduce every analysis and understand every decision even years later. This promotes reproducibility of code and thus the ability to improve future decisions. Modern tools encourage the intermingling of documentation and code so that reasoning for every decision is immediately available.
