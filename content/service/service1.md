Exploratory data analysis is the art and science of discovering relationships in data. It employs techniques from data visualization, description, transformation, and modeling to generate questions and hypotheses about the processes underlying your data. Effective data visualization can show you relationships among several variables, and effective modeling can quantify those relationships.
