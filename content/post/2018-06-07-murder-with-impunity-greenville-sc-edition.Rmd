The *Washington Post* recently had an article ["Murder with Impunity"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/unsolved-homicide-database/?utm_term=.540eacb9f59d) Where they collected and curated data on unsolved murders. They have published their raw data publicly (see the link for more info), and I analyze that here.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

if (!file.exists("homicide-data.csv")) {
  download.file(url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv",
                destfile = "homicide-data.csv")
}

homicide <- read_csv("homicide-data.csv")
```
